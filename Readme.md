# Simple Network File Sharing System
## Project Overview
This project provides a simple file-sharing solution for small groups (like a small office or a group of students) who need to share files over a local network. The solution enables users to upload files to a shared folder and download files shared by others, without relying on external cloud storage, USB drives, or email.

## Objective
To design and implement a network-based file-sharing system that allows users on the same local network to easily upload and download files. This system is ideal for environments where users need quick and convenient access to shared files, organized in a central location.

## Key Features
1. File Sharing: Allows users to upload and download files from a shared folder on the network.
2. Simple Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for viewing, uploading, and downloading files.
3. Basic Security: Includes basic authentication, ensuring only authorized users can access the shared files.
4. Platform Compatibility: Works across multiple operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and Linux.
